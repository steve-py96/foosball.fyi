# how to add your own rules / rule-page

First make sure the page you want to add does not exist already. If it isn't you have 2 options:

1. Open a PR on GitHub and create your page like any other or in an own way. Note: The slug of your page (aka the filename and assets folder name) must be the google maps path of the location where those rules apply.
2. Open an issue on GitHub with all the content you want covered on your page + the location name and a google maps link.

# how to fix an issue

Also here 2 options:

1. Open a PR on GitHub with the fixes.
2. Open an Issue that describes where to find the current issue and a description of how to resolve the issue.

# how to add a feature request

For a feature request there's only one option! :P
Open an issue on GitHub and describe the feature. Feel free (if you're lazy or not a coder) to add visualisations instead of describing logic. :)
