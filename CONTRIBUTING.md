# How to add rules etc...

## How to add your own rules / location page?

First make sure the page you want to add does not exist already on the [all-locations page] or in this repository itself. If it isn't you have 2 options:

1. Open a Pull Request on GitHub and create your page like any other or in an own way. Note: The slug of your page (aka the filename and assets folder name) must be the google maps path of the location where those rules apply.
2. Open an issue on GitHub with all the content you want covered on your page + the location name and a google maps link.

Note: The languages providable by the maintainers are only listed below... If you need a not-listed language you need to contribute the page yourself (aka step 1).

- German
- English

## How to fix an issue?

Also here 2 options:

1. Open a Pull Request on GitHub with the fixes.
2. Open an issue that describes where to find the current issue and a description of how to resolve the issue (no code needed necessarily, a description is enough).

## How to add a feature request?

Open an issue on GitHub and describe the feature. Feel free (if you're lazy or not a coder) to also add visualisations instead of describing textually only. :)

## How to add a language?

Open a Pull Request and create the language in the location directory of your desire (feel free to add your language anywhere you want to, never hurts to have more translations than less.. :P).

# Get listed as contributor

If you did any contribution yourself (code-wise) you can call the contributor node script with your github username to get added.
`GITHUB_USER=... pnpm exec add-contributor` (where "..." is to be replaced with your GitHub user).

Note: If you don't code yourself the person who handles your issue will add you.
